# Taskmaster Pro

## Description
Module 5 | Project
A company called Taskmaster has recruited you to expand their task-management application. To do this, you'll need to work with their existing codebase, which was built using jQuery, a third-party JavaScript library that simplifies DOM manipulation, and the front-end CSS library Bootstrap.

## Tools
* Bootstrap 
- is an open source responsive front-end component library for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. It uses a responsive grid system to allow for quick layouts in both development and production.
* jQuery
- is the most popular JavaScript library in the world. It simplifies DOM traversal and manipulation, event handling, and animation with an easy-to-use API.
* jQuery UI
- is a set of user interface interactions, effects, widgets, and themes built on top of the jQuery library, providing features such as drag and drop functionality and a date picker.
* jQuery UI Touch Punch
- is a small library that enables the use of touch events on sites using the jQuery UI library. This allows developers to use jQuery UI to create interfaces for mobile and touch devices.
* Moment.js
- is an open source JavaScript library that removes the need to use the native JavaScript Date object directly, making the Date object easier to parse, validate, and display.
* Google Fonts
- is a library of over 900 free licensed fonts, with an API for conveniently adding the fonts to your web application.
* Open Iconic
- is an open source icon font set that can help add meaning to elements of your website.
